# LetterboxdWidgets
Widgets for Letterboxd using [Scriptable](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1405459188). To use, download Scriptable, create a new script and paste it into the text field. On your home screen, add a widget of the correct size from Scriptable and set the script to the one you created.

Note: Widgets require the app they're run from to be opened before opening other apps. This is currently impossible to circumvent.
